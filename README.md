# Newt
Newt Parser Generator for C# (Retired)

please see LL https://github.com/codewitch-honey-crisis/LL for a better replacement

Newt generates C# classes to parse streams of input using grammars based on an EBNF variant.

It generates LL(1) parsers and supports transparent grammar refactoring.

It also supports attributes in the grammar.
